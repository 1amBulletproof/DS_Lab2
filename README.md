# DS_Lab2
repository for files associated with Lab2 for class 605.202 Data Structures @ JHU 

To run the program from the command line:
javac Lab2.java
java lab2 <inputFile.txt> <outputFile.txt>


About the program:
Takes matrixes as input from a text file, calculates determinant of each matrix
and outputs the matrix and its determinant to a separate file.

Matrix is 1-based

By default the program can handle any matrix up to size 10.
Minimal changes are needed as there is a matrix constructor which takes size as a parameter
